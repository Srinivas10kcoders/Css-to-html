    <p>Self-confidence is an attitude about your skills and abilities. It means you accept and trust yourself and have a
        sense of control in your life. You know your strengths and weakness well, and have a positive view of yourself.
        You set realistic expectations and goals, communicate assertively, and can handle criticism.</p>
